# Noteworthy

Noteworthy is an experimental distributed networking toolkit. It is similar to existing personal networking products such as ZeroTier and TailScale but is 100% community powered, free and open source software. 

Noteworthy's development is sponsored by Decentralabs LLC, a Wyoming based telecommuniations research and development firm that specializes in the development free and open source telecommunications infrastucture to enable a safe, free web.

# A Cost Gravity Driven Mission
Noteworthy is an ambitious open source project that aims to lower the cost of designing, deploying, maintaning small-to-medium scale distributed overlay networks and the applications that run on top of them. It is not enough to simply be open source. Technical complexity contributes substantially to the excessive cost of access which Noteworthy is designed to address.

# Getting started
By design, Noteworthy is easy to use because it's opinionated about defaults and things like deployment and orchestration. If you also have strong opinions about those sorts of things we'd appreciate your contributions to this project.

For now, Noteworthy's supported development and deployment environments are based on Docker.

Drop into a development container to play around with the `notectl` command-line utility

Make sure Docker is installed, check out this repo and run:

```
$ make shell
```
